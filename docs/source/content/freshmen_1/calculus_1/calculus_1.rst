Single Variable Calculus
========================

Prerequisites & Introduction
----------------------------

**Prerequisites:** :doc:`Precalculus <../precalculus/precalculus>`

A strong foundation in Algebra, Trigonometry, and key Precalculus topics is required. This includes, but is not limited to, sequences and series, polar coordinates, and parametric equations.

This course is the first in the standard university-level calculus sequence for most Computer Science programs. Universities typically offer this material over two or three semesters. This self-study guide adopts the structure used by MIT, dividing the subject into two distinct courses: 18.01 Single Variable Calculus and 18.02 Multivariable Calculus.

The curriculum for Single Variable Calculus covers Limits, Differentiation, Integration, Polar and Parametric Equations, and concludes with Infinite Sequences and Series.

Study Material
--------------

**Online Course**

The core learning materials, including lectures, assignments, and exams, are from MIT OpenCourseWare.

* `MIT OCW 18.01SC Single Variable Calculus (Fall 2010) <https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/>`_

The video lectures are from 2007, but don’t worry—calculus hasn’t changed in centuries. This is still an excellent course, taught by the well-known Prof. David Jerison. It’s rigorous, challenging, and gives you a deeper understanding than most standard university courses.

**Books**

*Main Textbook*: 

#. *Thomas' Calculus: Early Transcendentals*, 15th Edition, by George B. Thomas, Jr. et al.

   This is the recommended primary textbook for this study plan. It comprehensively covers all the necessary topics for single-variable calculus and aligns well with the MIT 18.01 OCW course structure. It is a more complete resource for the course material than the text by Simmons.

*Additional Books*:

#. *Calculus with Analytic Geometry*, 2nd Edition, by George F. Simmons

   This is the textbook officially listed by the 18.01 course. It is a valuable resource, and its explanations can be more intuitive in certain areas compared to *Thomas' Calculus*. However, it may lack the same level of mathematical rigor and depth in some topics. It serves well as a supplementary text for clarifying concepts.

#. *How to Ace Calculus: The Streetwise Guide*, by Abigail Thompson, Colin Adams, and Joel Hass
#. *How to Ace the Rest of Calculus: The Streetwise Guide*, by Colin Adams and Joel Haas

   These books offer an alternative approach to the material, often simplifying complex topics. They are useful resources to consult when the formality of a standard textbook proves to be a barrier to understanding a specific concept.

**Websites**

#. `The LibreTexts libraries <https://math.libretexts.org/>`_ provides a collection of open-source textbooks and other resources for mathematics.
#. `Paul's Online Notes <https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/>`_ is a well-regarded resource that offers clear explanations and worked examples. The notes can also be downloaded in PDF format for offline use.

Both websites are effective supplementary resources for gaining different perspectives on challenging topics.

Self-Evaluation
---------------

**Assignments**

#. The MIT OCW course includes a full set of assignments that should be completed. The recitation videos provide additional exercises that are solved with an instructor.
#. For further practice, solving relevant exercises from the *Thomas' Calculus* textbook is recommended but optional.

**Exams**

The course includes 4 closed-book midterms and 1 final open book exam.

In the original OCW version, the final is closed-book. However, since no review materials were provided for the final exam, I made it **open book**—otherwise it would’ve been extremely difficult to prepare, not knowing what would appear on the exam.
