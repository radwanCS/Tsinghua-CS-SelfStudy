PreCalculus
===========

Introduction
------------
**Prerequisites:** Basic high school math skills

Not everyone *needs* this, but here's why it helps: If equations make you break out in a sweat or Calculus sounds scary, this prep work could be your secret weapon.

Books

1. *Algebra and Trigonometry (4th Edition)* by James Stewart, Lothar Redlin, and Saleem Watson

   My go-to guide for shaking off the math rust. Pro tip: Stick with the odd-numbered problems (answers available online!) and skip the easy problems once you've got the idea. Why grind through 20 similar problems when 5 tough ones teach you more?

1. Book Exercises - Work Smarter

   Here's how to avoid burnout:
   - Do the odd-numbered problems (check your work as you go)
   - Skip questions that are redundant or offer no real challenge
   - Wrestle with the theory questions - they're gold
   - Camp out on topics that make your head spin

.. note::

   No required videos, but Khan Academy's great if you learn better by watching. Mix and match resources - whatever keeps you motivated!

Summary
-------
Here's the real talk about this book: It's like a math gym membership. Colleges use it to get students in shape for Calculus, but here's the catch...

- **Most CS programs jump straight to Calculus** (MIT, Tsinghua, etc.)
- **Math is cumulative** - Fall behind early, play catch-up all semester
- **You control the pace** - Build strength now or risk injury later

.. important::

   Let's get real about math: You can't cram it. This course is your safety net if:
   - Algebra feels like ancient hieroglyphics
   - Trig identities look like random scribbles
   - Abstract thinking isn't your superpower (yet!)
   Nail these basics now, and Calculus becomes way less terrifying.
