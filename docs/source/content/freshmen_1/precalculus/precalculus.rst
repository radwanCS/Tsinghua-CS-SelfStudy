PreCalculus
===========

Introduction
------------

**Prerequisites:** High school Mathematics.

This course is optional, but I recommend taking it if you're not confident enough in math or if you find Calculus challenging.


Study Material
--------------

Books
^^^^^

#. *Algebra and Trigonometry 4th Edition* by James Stewart, Lothar Redlin, Saleem Watson

This book serves as valuable reference material. It encompasses fundamental concepts. 
When it comes to the exercises in the book, I suggest doing the odd-numbered problems since they have solution manuals available online. 
Attempting to complete all exercises (odd and even) is not recommended as it might require an excessive amount of time.

Assignments

#. Solving the book exercises

For this course, After I finished reading the book I solved almost all odd-numbered questions. Most of the times I skipped the easy problems, but overall,
I managed to solve around 80-90% of all odd-numbered problems in the book.

Summary
-------

This book will serve as a sufficient resource to refresh your mathematical skills and
acquire the necessary knowledge before delving into Calculus and advanced mathematics.
The recommended book is taught at the college level during the freshman year,
aiming to prepare students who need to refresh their math skills for more advanced studies in mathematics.
Note that not all computer science programs teach this course; in fact, many computer science programs start with Calculus,
including Tsinghua University, MIT, and many others. Nevertheless, I still recommend taking this course if your weak in math.
