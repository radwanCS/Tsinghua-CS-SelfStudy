Introduction
============

Welcome to this Self Study Guide which is based on Tsinghua University curriculum for the computer science \& technology undergraduate program! Here's how this guide empowers your learning journey:

**Guided by Tsinghua:** We align with Tsinghua University's curriculum, ensuring comprehensive coverage of essential topics.

**Enrichment from REKCARC-TSC-UHT:** This project supplements our guide with additional course material, including homework, books, and exams.

**A Self-Study Roadmap:** This documentation serves as your roadmap to mastering computer science. It offers suggestions for books, online resources, and courses to help you gain the required knowledge in each subject.

Study Objective
---------------

We've made this guide to lead you to a complete education in computer science. It covers lots of different subjects, starting with the basics and then going into more specialized stuff.
As you go through this guide, you'll learn important theories, knowledge, and skills you need for computer science. But it's not just about what you learn, we also want to help you become 
a well-rounded person and encourage your creative thinking.

Our aim is to guide you become someone who can learn a lot on their own and adapt to different things. We want you to dream big and set goals for yourself, especially in the field of science.
By the end of this guide, you'll be ready to lead in computer science or make a big impact in the business world. You'll have the skills and knowledge to make a real difference.

Requirements
------------

According to Tsinghua University, Computer Science and Technology Graduates should possess the following knowledge and abilities:

1. Ability to apply mathematical, scientific, and engineering knowledge
2. Ability to design and conduct experiments, analyze and interpret data
3. Ability to design systems, devices, or processes that meet desired requirements while considering real constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health, safety, ease of processing, and sustainability
4. Ability to work in multidisciplinary teams
5. Ability to identify, propose, and solve engineering problems
6. Understanding of professional ethics and responsibilities in the field of study
7. Ability for effective communication
8. Possess a broad knowledge base, capable of recognizing the global, economic, environmental, and societal impact of engineering solutions
9. Recognize the importance of lifelong learning and have the ability to improve oneself through continuous learning
10. Possess knowledge to understand contemporary social and technological issues from a professional perspective
11. Ability to apply technology, skills, and modern engineering tools for engineering practice

Study Duration
--------------

At Tsinghua University, the undergraduate program for Computer Science and Technology spans four years, culminating in the conferment of a Bachelor of Engineering degree.
The curriculum and credit distribution align with the undergraduate program's duration. The maximum allowable period for undergraduate study is the program duration (4 years) with an additional two years.

Considering the approach in this guide, the program duration is estimated to range between 3-4 years. By excluding extracurricular courses typically included in most university programs and focusing solely on essential subjects, we prioritize efficiency. However, there's no strict timeline for program completion. 
Individuals may finish all courses in 3, 4, or even 5 years, allowing flexibility and self-pacing.

For those you want to follow a strict timeline The recommended duration falls within the range of 3-4 years.

In each course, I have noted the dates when I began and completed the course, along with the duration it took.
Please note that the provided duration is just an estimate, as you may finish earlier or take much longer, depending on your pace.
This information is included for my personal progress tracking and to serve as a reference for visitors and readers of this guide.

Basic Credit Requirements
-------------------------

At Tsinghua University, the undergraduate education mandates a total credit requirement of 160 credits.
This encompasses 46 credits designated for university-level general education courses, 95 credits dedicated to major-related courses,
and an additional 19 credits allocated for practical components within the major.

.. note::

   Only subjects directly related to computer science will be included in this guide. 
   To meet the required credits, consider taking more specialized computer science courses from the 3rd and 4th years.

Curriculum Setting and Credit Distribution
------------------------------------------

As stated earlier only subjects related to computer science \& IT well be included
