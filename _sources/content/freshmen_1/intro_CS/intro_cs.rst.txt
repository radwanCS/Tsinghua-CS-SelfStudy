Books
^^^^^

**1. "Computer Science: An Overview, 13th Edition" by J. Glenn Brookshear and Dennis Brylow**

This book consists of 13 chapters and provides a broad overview of computer science, covering various specializations and key concepts in the field.  

- Some chapters may be challenging, but this is expected, as the book introduces a wide range of topics.  
- You are not expected to master everything immediately—focus on understanding the fundamental concepts and gaining insight into the field.  
- If you choose to solve all the exercises and explore topics in depth, the course may take longer, but this is optional.  
- This book is widely used, including at Tsinghua University for its Introduction to Computer Science course.  

For guidance on key chapters and topics to focus on, refer to the **Summary** section.

Summary
-------

The book alone should be sufficient for learning the fundamentals. However, you can also refer to additional resources, such as:

- **THU-CST-Cracker**: A collection of past exam papers, syllabi, and supplementary materials from Tsinghua University's computer science program.
