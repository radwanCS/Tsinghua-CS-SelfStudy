Introduction
============

Welcome to this Self-Study Guide, which is based on personal experience, various online resources, and curricula from well-known universities such as MIT, Harvard, and Tsinghua for the Computer Science \& Technology undergraduate program.

Here's how this guide empowers your learning journey:

**Based on popular universities:** We align the guide with curricula from MIT, Harvard, Tsinghua University, and other reputable institutions to ensure comprehensive coverage of essential topics.

**Enriched by online resources:** We supplement the guide with additional course materials, including homework, books, and exams from free online resources.

**A self-study roadmap:** This documentation serves as a roadmap for mastering computer science. It offers suggestions for free online courses, books, and guides to help you acquire the required knowledge in each subject.

Study Objective
---------------

We've created this guide to lead you toward a complete education in computer science. It covers a wide range of subjects, starting with the fundamentals and progressing to more specialized topics. As you follow the guide, you'll learn the core theories, knowledge, and practical skills needed for computer science. Beyond technical content, we aim to help you become a well-rounded thinker and to encourage creativity.

Our goal is to help you become an independent learner who can adapt to new challenges. We want you to set ambitious goals in the field of science. By the end of this guide, you should be prepared to lead in computer science or to make a significant impact in industry or research.

Study Duration
--------------

At MIT, Harvard, Tsinghua, and many other universities, the undergraduate program in Computer Science and Technology typically spans four years and leads to a Bachelor of Engineering degree. The curriculum and credit distribution are designed for that duration. The maximum allowable period for undergraduate study is the program duration (4 years) plus an additional two years.

For the purposes of this guide, the program duration is set to four years. By excluding many extracurricular courses found in typical university programs and focusing on essential subjects, we prioritize efficiency. However, there is no strict timeline for completion: individuals may finish in 3, 4, or 5 years depending on pace and circumstances. 

Because the courses in this guide closely mirror what you would experience in person at a university, we expect that most learners will need approximately 3–4 years to complete the core requirements.

Basic Requirements
------------------

Many universities, including Tsinghua, mandate a total number of credits for an undergraduate degree.

This guide adopts a different approach: courses are divided into foundational (compulsory) courses and elective (optional) courses. Foundational courses cover the essential, standard topics every computer science student should take. Elective courses are optional; you choose them according to your interests and the direction you want your studies to take.

Once you finish the foundations, you will have enough exposure to the field to make informed choices about which elective courses are best for you.

.. note::

   Only subjects directly related to computer science are included in this guide. Unlike many universities, this guide excludes unrelated or irrelevant courses.

Foundational Courses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The foundational courses are compulsory. They cover mathematics and natural science foundations, core subject foundations, practical components, and other essential areas. These courses provide the theories, methods, skills, and abilities necessary for in-depth study and research in computer science and technology.

.. note::

   This is a preview list of courses that may be added in the future; it is illustrative only and does not represent a final or official curriculum.
