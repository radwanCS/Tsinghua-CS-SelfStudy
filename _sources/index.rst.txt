Welcome to the Computer Science & Technology Self-Study Guide!
==============================================================

A self-study guide for **Computer Science & Technology**, based on my personal experience and authentic curricula from universities such as MIT, Harvard, Stanford, and Tsinghua.  
It also draws on the many freely available open-source online learning platforms, including MIT OCW, Coursera, and others.
